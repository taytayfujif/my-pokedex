## My Pokedex
In this project, we will be working with the **DOM** and **HTML** concepts.

## Objective
To manipulate the each Pokemon descripton in the **HTML** by using the **DOM** in our Javascript file. 

## Prerequisites
In order to complete this project students must have the following:<br>
- Basic understanding of Github forking and cloning. 
- Basic understanding of HTML structures. 
- Basic understanding of DOM.

## Requirements
To complete this project you will need the following:
- Shell to use the command line
- Sublime Text

## Desired Outcome
At the completion of this exercise, students should understand:
- Better understanding of the HTML structure
- Modifying HTML Elements through the DOM

## Your Challenge
1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Clone** this repository from your personal Github account:
    - Copy HTTP address on the page. 
    - In your **webdev** folder on your **desktop**, run the command `git clone [insert the github http url address copied from github]` in order to clone that repository into your folder. 
3. Navigate into the my-pokedex folder by using the command `cd my-pokedex`
4. Open my-pokedex folder in your **Sublime Text Editor** by selecting **File** then **Open Folder**
5. You will be following instructions and writing your code in the `app.js` file
6. After you complete the first instruction open up your terminal (double check to see if you're in the correct directory) and run the command `live-server`. This will render a new browser to open for you to see your results.

*Note:* You only need to run the `live-server` command once, it will keep running and refreshing the browser after every time you make a save in your files.
